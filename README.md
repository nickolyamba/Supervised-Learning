1) Models computed using WEKA CLI via Linux bash scripts:
 - Decision Trees
 - Boosted Decision Trees
 - ANN

Bash Scripts require a certain pre-created folder structure for data input and output. This structure can be found in bash variables at the top of the bash files.


2) Models computed using Scikit Learn
 - KNN
 - SVM

The code also requires installed libraries used in the code such as numpy, matplotlib, pandas, sklearn
Datasets can be found on Google Drive: https://goo.gl/Bu56rb
