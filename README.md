**Used datasets:**<br>
1. [Default of Credit Card Clients](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients)<br>
2. [White Wine Quality](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)


1) Models computed using WEKA CLI and Linux Bash scripts:
 - Decision Trees
 - Boosted Decision Trees
 - ANN

Bash Scripts require a certain pre-created folder structure for the data input and output. This structure can be found in bash variables at the top of the each file.


2) Models computed using Scikit-Learn:
 - KNN
 - SVM

The code also requires installed libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, pandas, sklearn. [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and [Spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder) were also used for the development.
