**Used datasets:**<br>
1. [Default of Credit Card Clients](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients)<br>
2. [White Wine Quality](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)


1) Models computed using WEKA CLI and Linux Bash scripts:
 - Decision Trees
 - Boosted Decision Trees
 - ANN

Bash Scripts require a certain pre-created folder structure for the data input and output. This structure can be found in bash variables at the top of each script file and can be customized.


2) Models computed using Scikit-Learn:
 - KNN
 - SVM

The code also requires the following libraries: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and sklearn.
